# About  the looper:

All the selections are defined  in app/HHLooper.cc in the cutflow object

`cutflow.addCut`: start a cut

`cutflow.addCutToLastActiveCut`:  add a cut on top of the cut in the previous line

`cutflow.getCut`: get a cut in a cutflow

To define a cut  in addCut or addCutToLastActiveCut, you need to give the cutname, a lambda function for a bool return, and a weight 

For example, cut `SRBin2` contains the following cutflow: `CutWeight` -> `CutHLT` -> `CutfatJetsPt` -> `CutfatJetsMassSD` -> `SRBin2`


All the output histograms are defined in  app/HHLooper.cc in the histograms object

Each output histogram will have the name of `CutName__HistogramName`, i.e. by default the program saves all histograms for all cuts in the cut flow defined above


# Run looper

```
./process.sh tag0 yes
```

The first argument is a tag for the folder name of the output histograms, and the second argument tells the program to include all the systematic Up/Down histograms

There will be segment fault error, just ignore it...

# Make root file for datacard
```
cd python
python prepare_card.py tag0
```

The argument of the python script is the tag name you provided in the previous step

# make plots

```
cd python
./plot_all.sh tag0
```
